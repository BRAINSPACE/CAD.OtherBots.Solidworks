## Overview

This design is based on the original VoxelOx from 

It's a hybrid CNC / 3D Printer that can be adapted to any height

## Version 1

This is the original version of the Voxel Ox sourced from
http://www.openbuilds.com/builds/voxel-ox-extendable-3d-printer-and-cnc-platform.2418/
but modeled into solidwrks

Some of the pulley housings have been modified to use existing solidworks parts.
Note with this model there may be clearnace issues with the L bracket / pulley on the X Axis

## Version 2

Version 2 is my own model usng C-Beam and Nema 23 Motors for the design
Some of this design is taken from the C-Beam machine:

Parts in the Bom are ooznest sice they're closer / based in the UK

## TODO

 * don't forget belt clamps, we also need to use GT3 belts and pulleys for nema23
 * get some self tapping screws to tap the holes of the extrusion

 * side panels to stop stuff spraying out during cncing
 * and look into the extra strong belt with steel in from ebay
 * do the bom

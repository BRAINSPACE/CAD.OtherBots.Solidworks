# Material Thickness

## MDF Thickness

One of the things to watch out for when making something like this is the thickness of the MDF being laser cut.
According to the forums the thickness should be 1/4" inch (American Standards) which in theory should be 6.35mm.
However all the slots on the default diagrams are rigged for a thickness of 5.35mm instead which is a bit odd.
It could be a way to make sure the parts stick together because of the laser kerf, I need to experiment with the laser cutter to find out.

UK Standard thickness's for MDF include 3mm, 6mm, 9mm, 12mm, 18mm
The closest match to the existing diagrams is around 6mm, which a 40W laser should be able to handle without problems.
Although if your going to use the models from here for cutting I would recommend adjusting the slots from 5.35 to 6mm
and making sure everything matches up.

My Plan is to build a beefier version of the MakerSmith using 12mm thickness for additional rigidity, and steppers instead of servos.
The main problems will be adjusting the diagrams for 12mm thickness while maintaining the same clearances, and finding a laser powerful enough to cut it

Getting the dimensions correct is fairly critical since MDF is quite hard, and isn't very tolerant of a big slot being bashed into a smaller hole.

## Laser Kerf

One of the things to be aware of when cutting parts is the kerf of the laser.
In other words there may be a shrinkage of the part based on the type / thickness of the material and laser settings
anywhere between 0.45mm - 0.08mm, so it's probably best to do some test cuts first of a square.
Then measure with a pair of callipers to see how the sizes compare with the ideal for any offsets you might need to add
